A program that calculates every Harshad number up to five hundred million (500,000,000 or 5ร10^8).

### What is a Harshad number?
According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harshad_number), a harshad number is a number in a given base that is divisible by the sum of its digits when written in that base. 

Basically, if I take a number (e.g. 954) and divide it by the sum of the digits (9+5+4), the answer should be whole: 954 รท (9+5+4) = 53, which is whole.

### What's the point?

Because I can. :)
